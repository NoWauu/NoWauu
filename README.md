### 💬 About me

I am a 18 year old french student, working to get the **Full Stack developer** status. I'm currently in BUT INFO, where I learn some things about programming and around that. I still learn various things in my spare time and, I enjoy discovering new features and programming languages as well as new technologies.
I avoided frameworks until soon where I learnt `NextJS`, and I will learn multiple others, like `Vue.js` at school, but I'll keep learning on my side (things like `C++`/`C#`/`Angular`) while making projects to apply my skills.

I discovered programming in Jr High school, where I started to ask myself how does games actually work. Then, I started reading and learning some things on my side, coding little things for myself in Java using the *Spigot API*, made for Minecraft plugins usage. Later on, I met a friend who taught me all the `Java` and programming essentials I did not know by the time.
I started coding for friends, while keeping in touch with new updates. Then I discovered `Python` in high school and used that during all high school and even now in uni.
I learnt `C` and `RISC Assembly`, `JavaScript`, `jQuery`, Web development (deeper that I already knew) and `Java`. 

For now I still am in the first year, but I will discover new things by the future. 😉
